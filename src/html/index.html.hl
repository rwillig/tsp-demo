            <h2>Capacitated Vehicle Routing</h2>
            <p>
                Suppose you're a distributor of, say, bakery supplies and you have 50 deliveries to make today. You'd like to figure 
                out the best route that minimizes the distance that your truck has to drive. Vehicle wear and tear costs per mile can 
                range from about $0.60 to $1.40 depending on the size of the vehicle. Now, the difference between a good route and a 
                not so good route could be more than double, but even driving just 20 miles per day fewer could result in over $5000 
                in savings per vehicle per year. (20 miles x 260 days x $1.00 avg cost)
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, to make the problem a little harder, let's say you have more stuff to deliver than can fit into one truck. 
                Fortunately you have several trucks. Now you have to solve the capacitated vehicle routing problem. This means that before 
                you can figure out the best route for each truck, you have to first figure out which stuff to put in each truck.
            </p>
            <p>
                The demo on the next page will allow you to experiment with some of these different scenarios. You'll see a list of 50 
                bakeries which represent the possible deliveries. Below that is a list of 4 possible warehouses. At a minimum, you must 
                choose at least 6 stops and depot from which to deliver. In order to test the capacitation component, you can select 
                multiple trucks from the truck drop-down. The capacity slider is to set the capacity of each truck.
            </p>
            <p>
               So, for example, a good scenario for testing a 4 truck example would be select all 50 stops (a shortcut checkbox on 
               the bottom will select all stops) and select 4 trucks. Then set the capacity slider to 13. This will fill each of the 
               first 3 trucks with 13 of the stops (each stop has a load of 1) and the last truck will take 11 stops.

            <h2>Hoplon</h2>
            <p>
              Hoplon is a framework for developing web applications which promises *a simpler way to program the web*. There are 
              several profound technical reasons for this and a review along with elaboration of the technical benefits can be
              found <a href="http://http://hoplon.io/#/benefits/">here</a> 
            </p>
            <p>
              There are some very clear wins on the business side that flow from these benefits: a spreadsheet-like state model for 
              web apps easily understood by non-technical subject matter experts, use of datomic, an immutable database of facts 
              providing full data provenance, and a predictable development timeline. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The spreadsheet-like model (sometimes called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming">dataflow programmingi</a>) makes things 
              much simpler from the programming side of things but it has added benefit 
              for business stakeholders. It's an entrenched metaphor that nearl everyone in business can not only understand but has probably used
              extensively throughout their career. So it doesn't require non-technical subject matter experts (SMEs) to learn a new vocabulary
              in order to participate fully in the design/specification process. This leads to fewer instances of mis-communication between product
              and engineering. 
            </p>
            <p>
              This leads to fewer bugs in two different ways. There are fewer logic bugs introduced by programmers because the state model
              of the web app is so simple and fewer design bugs that introduced by poor communication. Inevitably, this virtuous cycle produces software 
              that is easier to maintain, but more importantly, software that's easier to modify as new features are required or changes to the business model 
              requires pivots.
            </p>
            <p>
              Applications built using the hoplon framework are designed to leverage an immutable database of facts. This can be thought of as a version control
              system for data like, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">git</a>. This makes it simple to ask all sorts of questions of the form
              "what was the state the system at time x?" This could be something like "how many active clients did we have at the end of the 3rd quarter last year" 
              These are, of course, the simplest examples and could be handled simply with other schemes, but perhaps only if you thought about them ahead of time. 
              This becomes much harder when changing business requirements require asking those questions on an ad hoc basis well after the fact.
